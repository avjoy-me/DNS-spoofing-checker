# DNS-spoofing-checker
This repository contains a Python script to check for DNS spoofing by querying multiple DNS servers in Taiwan. The script verifies whether the DNS servers return the correct IP address for a specified domain. The results are displayed in the terminal and saved to a text file for further analysis.
